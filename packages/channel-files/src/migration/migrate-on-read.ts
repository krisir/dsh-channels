/**
 * Lazy migration ON READ (attachment-gateway plan §15 / §28 — Phase F, P1-4,
 * test matrix §34).
 *
 * NOT YET WIRED into the resolve flow. This module is standalone, default-off
 * infrastructure: the first release ships with `migration.nativeOnRead =
 * false` (plan §28) and the resolver turn-on is a later wave (plan P1-4). Only
 * when `enabled` is true AND the running Harness host reports a generic
 * attachment capability does a read of a legacy record trigger a copy.
 *
 * Contract (plan §15 / §15.1 / §15.2 / §28):
 *
 * - never MOVE or DELETE legacy bytes — migration is copy + verify + retain
 *   (`legacyRetained: true`); deleting legacy bytes is GC's job, separate from
 *   the migration transaction (plan §16);
 * - copy to native -> read back -> verify sha256 + bytes -> catalog switch;
 * - ANY failure (copy fail, read-back fail, hash mismatch, length mismatch,
 *   catalog get/update fail or throw, missing catalog record) ->
 *   `{ outcome: 'legacy-authoritative' }`: legacy remains authoritative and
 *   readable, the catalog is unchanged;
 * - a record already at `harness-native` is an idempotent no-op
 *   (`{ outcome: 'migrated' }`, nothing copied).
