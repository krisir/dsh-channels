/**
 * Multi-channel binary ingress contract for DingTalk.
 *
 * Every case drives the REAL inbound entry — `InboundProcessor.handle(raw)` —
 * mirroring `test/image-hydration.test.ts` / `test/media-hydration.test.ts`:
 * an injected fake secure fetcher (`RemoteMediaFetchLike.fetchBounded`)
 * returns deterministic bytes for the fixture's genuine http(s) media URLs
 * (image `picUrl`, audio/video `mediaUrl`), failures would stamp a stable
 * `ingressFailure`, and the emitted `message.received` is captured from a
 * `ChannelService` listener and returned to the runner.
 *
 * Fixture-driven byte claim: image. Audio/video hydration remains covered by
 * `test/media-hydration.test.ts`, but those synthetic URL/downloadCode tests
 * are not platform evidence, so the adapter conservatively declares locator
 * support until the official API plus live gate are verified.
 * - file: no fixtures/dingtalk/inbound-file.json -> SKIPPED (plan: prefer
 *   documented skips over invented fixtures).
